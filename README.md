## Abstract
This project aims to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model capable of generating a script for the popular TV series "The Office (US)". Utilizing dialogues from all nine seasons that aired on the show as a dataset, we experiment with various deep learning architectures, such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, deep neural networks. The resulting model will produce a script containing character names followed by their respective lines of dialogue, capturing the essence of the show's unique humor and style.
